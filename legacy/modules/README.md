This folder is maintaining forks of external resources that I have needed to
adapt to my project. The first case is react-color where I needed to remove
part of the component, and also avoid some inline css injected by the component
by adding some classes to my own css.

This module has to be copied into webapp/node_modules if it is reinstalled by
yarn.
